But here\'s the sober truth: we\'ve been doing much of this long before MCP arrived — it just wasn\'t standardized. Let\'s peel back the layers.\\n\\n![Model Context Protocols](https://gs8r2a1o6v.ufs.sh/f/mIz0GfQ1TSOpqZeM4zaMyAvRjGmzIU7kP02W5fhXlonVHC8B)\\n\\n## So, what  _really_  is an MCP server?\\n\\n**MCP**  stands for  **Model Context Protocol**  — an open-source standard released by Anthropic in late 2024 to let AI models connect to tools, data sources, files, databases, web APIs, and more.\\n\\nPicture it as a translator: instead of prompts or vector embeddings, you now get JSON-structured dialogues saying, “I want to run this function on GitHub” or “read these files.”\\n\\nThat\'s what an  **MCP server**  handles:\\n\\n-   Tool discovery\\n-   Structured requests\\n-   Execution and response\\n-   Error handling  \\n    All wrapped in one easy protocol.\\n\\n## Wait — didn\'t agents already do that?\\n\\nAbsolutely.  **Before MCP**, you could:\\n\\n-   Build a Claude or ChatGPT plugin using function-calling\\n-   Write glue code (scripts that poll data and format responses)\\n-   Use tools like Puppeteer or LangChain to simulate agent behavior\\n\\nSo yes —  **the core idea isn\'t new**. MCP is just an agreed-upon layer of  **generalization**.\\n\\nEvery integration earlier was custom. With MCP, you write a server once and plug it into any compliant AI. That\'s the difference.\\n\\n## So what can MCP do that we couldn\'t do before?\\n\\nThere\'s no magic — it\'s about  **scalability and simplicity**.\\n\\n### Before MCP\\n\\n-   You had to write  **custom code per integration**\\n-   AI relied on  **manual instructions**  from developers\\n-   Embedded files were often  **static or stale**\\n-   **Manual workflows**  were stitched together across tools\\n-   Security was  **ad-hoc**, handled case by case\\n\\n### After MCP\\n\\n-   A  **single MCP server**  can serve many different models\\n-   Tools can be discovered automatically via a  **JSON spec**\\n-   Models can  **fetch real-time live data**, not just preloaded content\\n-   You can chain tools together easily (e.g.,  **GitHub → Slack → Notion**)\\n-   **Consent, authentication, and audit**  are built into the protocol\\n\\nIt saves  **engineering time**,  **reduces error**, and helps  **standardize access**  across agents.\\n\\n## What could we do before MCP? Real examples:\\n\\nHere\'s what developers  _already_  did without MCP:\\n\\n-   **Code Automation**: Claude + GitHub API → Create PRs and merge automatically\\n-   **Docs Processing**: Poll Google Drive + convert docs to Markdown + summarize\\n-   **Data Fetching**: Web scraping latest stock prices → JSON → Summarize via GPT\\n-   **Slack Workflows**: Webhook triggers + message posting via Node.js\\n\\nWe were doing all this! It just wasn\'t reusable or standardized.\\n\\n## Friendly Metaphor: USB-C for AI Tools\\n\\nMCP is like  **USB-C**.\\n\\n> Just plug in a server, let the AI discover what tools are available, and start using them.\\n\\nThere\'s no need for hardcoded APIs or bespoke wrappers anymore.\\nEven Microsoft is now adding native MCP support into its  **Windows AI Foundry**, letting you ask AI to “fetch this Excel file” or “show all images from yesterday” securely and naturally.\\n\\n## Caveats & Reality Check\\n\\n**Security**  matters.\\n\\n-   Malicious servers could inject code or access sensitive data\\n-   Token misuse or prompt injection can still happen\\n-   Anthropic and other providers are working on mitigations like:\\n-   **MCP Guardian**  (sandboxing and throttling)\\n-   **MCPSafetyScanner**  (audits and scanning)\\n-   **RBAC policies and consent prompts**\\n\\nYou still need to  **design for safety**  — but now you don\'t need to reinvent that wheel either.\\n\\n## What\'s Changed After MCP?\\n\\n### Setup\\n\\n-   **Before MCP**: Manual wiring of each tool and model\\n-   **After MCP**: Unified setup using a shared protocol\\n\\n### Tool Usage\\n\\n-   **Before MCP**: Custom integrations for each individual model\\n-   **After MCP**:  **Model-agnostic**  design, tools can be reused across models\\n\\n### Security\\n\\n-   **Before MCP**: DIY security with custom scripts\\n-   **After MCP**:  **Built-in**  features like consent flows,  **role-based access control (RBAC)**, and detailed audit logs\\n\\n### Tool Chaining\\n\\n-   **Before MCP**: Complex and brittle orchestration\\n-   **After MCP**: Natively supported tool chaining, easier automation\\n\\n### Discovery\\n\\n-   **Before MCP**: Static list of tools, often hardcoded\\n-   **After MCP**:  **Dynamic discovery**, guided by the AI itself\\n\\n## Bottom Line\\n\\nMCP didn\'t invent AI agents or tool use — it  **standardizes**  what many devs already built manually.\\n\\nIt\'s like finally agreeing on  **how all tools should connect**, instead of writing ad-hoc glue code for each one.\\n\\nIt doesn\'t make your AI smarter — but it makes your integrations  **workable at scale**, discoverable, secure, and future-proof.\\n\\nSo beyond the hype:  **MCP servers just wrapped years of custom engineering into a clean, open protocol**. And honestly? That\'s a big deal.\\n\\n## 👉 Resources & Further Reading\\n\\n-   [Model Context Protocol (Official)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)\\n-   [Anthropic\'s GitHub examples](https://github.com/anthropics/mcp-examples)\\n-   [Understanding MCP Servers — Chatmaxima](https://chatmaxima.com/blog/understanding-mcp-servers-a-game-changer-for-ai-integration-and-beyond/)\\n-   [MCP Security Risks Research (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11154)\\n-   [Windows AI Foundry + MCP Integration](https://www.theverge.com/news/669298/microsoft-windows-ai-foundry-mcp-support)\\n\\n> “The biggest innovations often feel boring to engineers — because they make the hard parts disappear.”_  \\n> — Probably someone who\'s tired of maintaining glue code_"},"getting-started-with-docker":{"title":"Getting Started with Docker 🐳","publishDate":"Oct 22, 2024","imageUrl":"/blogs/getting-started-with-docker.png","link":"/blogs/getting-started-with-docker","externalLink":"https://day-1-of-my-devops-journey-docker.hashnode.dev/day-1-of-my-devops-journey-getting-started-with-docker","markdownContent":"Today marks the beginning of my DevOps learning journey, and I kicked it off by diving into Docker.

Little did I know that these three months would be a whirlwind of learning, challenges, and growth that would shape my understanding of AI applications in the real world.\\n\\n# The Journey Begins\\n\\nOn April 9, 2024 I started working at Workplete (https://workplete.com/) Project of Persist Ventures and a mix of excitement and nervousness coursing through me. The team\'s warm welcome immediately put me at ease, and I was quickly introduced to the one of the two main projects I\'d be working on: an Automatic Form Filler.\\n\\n## Project 1: Automatic Form Filler (AFF)\\n\\n![automatic form filler](https://gs8r2a1o6v.ufs.sh/f/mIz0GfQ1TSOp3BbFXH7p9cHFJMoKLVOdtle70W6DbmjG4BfQ)\\n\\nMy first task was to develop a Chrome extension that could automatically fill out online forms across multiple websites. Sounds simple, right? Well, not quite.\\n\\nThe challenge was to make it intelligent enough to understand different form structures so that it can work around any sort of website with forms and accurately map user-provided information to the correct fields.\\nThe learning curve was steep. I had to quickly get up to speed with Chrome extension development, dive deep into the world of GPT-4 for intelligent field mapping, and learn how to optimize API calls to keep costs down. One of the biggest hurdles was handling the context length for GPT-4. The solution? Implementing FAISS Vector DB to reduce token length. It was my first time working with vector databases, and it opened up a whole new world of possibilities.\\n\\nSeeing the extension\'s accuracy improve from 40% to 76% for the given sheet of different form links over the development period was incredibly rewarding. Even more gratifying was the positive feedback from beta testers, who reported saving a lot of time filling repetitive forms. It was my first taste of creating something that directly impacted users\' lives.\\n\\n## Project 2: Multi-Action Agent (MAA)\\n\\n![Multi-Action Agent (MAA)](https://gs8r2a1o6v.ufs.sh/f/mIz0GfQ1TSOpZeKacxbsS74AXGUqul8gRNcVemdrQx19zbfJ)\\n\\nJust as I was getting comfortable with the AFF, I was thrown into the deep end with the Multi-Action Agent project.\\n\\nThis was next-level stuff — an AI-powered browser assistant that could perform complex, multi-step tasks based on natural language commands.\\nThe MAA pushed my skills to the limit. I had to grapple with natural language understanding, autonomous web navigation, and visual understanding of web pages using GPT-4\'s vision capabilities. The Chrome Debugger API became my new best friend (and occasional nemesis) as I worked on giving the agent more control over the browser.\\n\\nOne of the most exciting moments was when we successfully tested the MAA on tasks like **booking a cab on Uber or sending a WhatsApp message —all initiated with a simple text command.** It felt like we were building the future of web interaction.\\n\\n# Beyond Technical Skills\\n\\nWhile the technical skills I gained were invaluable, the soft skills I developed were equally important. I learned how to communicate complex technical concepts with the team. Team meetings and code reviews improved my ability to give and receive constructive feedback.\\nOne of the most memorable experiences was presenting our projects to potential investors. It was nerve-wracking but exhilarating, and it gave me a glimpse into the business side of tech.\\n\\n# Reflecting on the Journey\\n\\nAs I wrapped up my internship on July 1, 2024, I couldn\'t believe how much I had learned in just three months. From Chrome extension development to AI integration, from database management to UX design considerations, the experience was comprehensive and eye-opening.\\n\\nBut beyond the technical skills, this internship taught me about the real-world application of AI. It showed me how theoretical concepts I\'d learned in university translated into products that could genuinely improve people\'s lives. It ignited a passion for creating AI-powered tools that are not just technically impressive, but also user-friendly and practical.\\n\\nTo all students considering internships: take the leap. The learning, the challenges, the victories — they\'re all part of an incredible journey that will shape your future in tech.\\n\\nAs I head back to complete my degree, I carry with me not just new skills and knowledge, but a renewed excitement for the future of AI and my role in shaping it. The journey has just begun, and I can\'t wait to see where it leads next.\\n\\nThis internship was more than just a summer job. It was a glimpse into the future — both the industry\'s and my own. And if this is just the beginning, I can\'t wait to see what comes next."}}'))},94376,e=>{"use strict";let n=(0,e.i(75254).default)("move-right",[["path",{d:"M18 8L22 12L18 16",key:"1r0oui"}],["path",{d:"M2 12H22",key:"1m8cig"}]]);e.s(["MoveRight",()=>n],94376)},4637,e=>{"use strict";var n=e.i(43476),t=e.i(67881),o=e.i(94376),a=e.i(46932),i=e.i(22016);e.s(["default",0,()=>(0,n.jsx)(a.motion.div,{initial:{opacity:0,y:-30},whileInView:{opacity:1,y:0},viewport:{once:!0,amount:.2},transition:{duration:.6,ease:"easeOut"},children:(0,n.jsx)(t.Button,{asChild:!0,className:"cursor-pointer group flex flex-col items-start w-full h-auto rounded-2xl hover:bg-primary py-4",variant:"secondary",children:(0,n.jsxs)(i.default,{href:"https://www.linkedin.com/in/pankil-soni-5a0541170/",target:"_blank",className:"flex flex-col gap-4",children:[(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"relative w-full flex justify-between",children:[(0,n.jsxs)("h2",{className:"text-start text-4xl lg:text-6xl",children:["Let's",(0,n.jsx)("br",{}),(0,n.jsx)("span",{className:"text-primary group-hover:dark:text-white transition-colors duration-300",children:"Connect"})]}),(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"relative h-12 w-12 bg-primary my-2 rounded-full group-hover:bg-white transition-colors duration-300 overflow-hidden",children:(0,n.jsxs)(a.motion.div,{className:"absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center",initial:!1,children:[(0,n.jsx)(a.motion.div,{className:"absolute",initial:{x:0,y:0,opacity:1},whileHover:{x:20,y:-20,opacity:0},transition:{duration:.3,ease:"easeInOut"},children:(0,n.jsx)(o.MoveRight,{className:"dark:text-white -rotate-45 size-5 group-hover:translate-x-5 group-hover:-translate-y-5 group-hover:opacity-0 transition-all duration-300"})}),(0,n.jsx)(a.motion.div,{className:"absolute",children:(0,n.jsx)(o.MoveRight,{className:"text-primary -rotate-45 size-5 -translate-x-5 translate-y-5 opacity-0 group-hover:translate-x-0 group-hover:translate-y-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-all duration-300"})})]})})]}),(0,n.jsx)("p",{className:"text-start text-base dark:text-white/80 font-normal text-wrap pr-8 md:pr-0 leading-tight",children:"Connect with me on linkedin to Hire me or Contact me to create any projects, get services from me or feel free to connect with me for any reasons."})]})})})])},64616,e=>{"use strict";var n=e.i(43476),t=e.i(57688),o=e.i(70065),a=e.i(22016),i=e.i(19981),s=e.i(46932);let r=({title:e,publishDate:i,imageUrl:r,link:l})=>(0,n.jsx)(s.motion.div,{initial:{opacity:0,y:-30},whileInView:{opacity:1,y:0},viewport:{once:!0,amount:.2},transition:{duration:.6,ease:"easeOut"},children:(0,n.jsxs)(o.Card,{className:"group pt-0 rounded-3xl overflow-hidden shadow-lg hover:shadow-2xl transition-shadow duration-300 bg-accent",children:[(0,n.jsx)(o.CardContent,{className:"p-0",children:(0,n.jsx)(a.default,{href:l,children:(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"w-full h-48 relative",children:(0,n.jsx)(t.default,{src:r,alt:e,fill:!0,className:"object-cover group-hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-300"})})})}),(0,n.jsx)(o.CardFooter,{children:(0,n.jsxs)("div",{children:[(0,n.jsx)("p",{className:"text-muted-foreground",children:i}),(0,n.jsx)("h3",{className:"text-2xl font-semibold mb-2 group-hover:text-primary",children:e})]})})]})});e.s(["BlogCard",0,r,"default",0,()=>(0,n.jsx)("div",{children:(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 gap-8 lg:gap-4",children:Object.keys(i.default).map(e=>{let t=i.default[e];return(0,n.jsx)(r,{title:t.title,publishDate:t.publishDate,imageUrl:t.imageUrl,link:t.link},t.title)})})})])},85138,e=>{"use strict";var n=e.i(43476),t=e.i(64616),o=e.i(47123),a=e.i(57196),i=e.i(4637),s=e.i(46932);e.s(["default",0,()=>(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"mt-12 lg:mt-16 max-w-[90vw] md:max-w-3xl lg:max-w-5xl mx-auto flex flex-col space-y-10 lg:flex-row lg:gap-20",children:[(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"order-2 mt-20 lg:mt-0 lg:order-1",children:(0,n.jsx)(o.default,{})}),(0,n.jsxs)(s.motion.div,{initial:{opacity:0,y:-30},animate:{opacity:1,y:0},transition:{duration:.6,ease:"easeOut",delay:.1},className:"order-1 lg:order-2 space-y-6",children:[(0,n.jsxs)("h1",{className:"sm:max-w-lg lg:max-w-max mx-auto text-center lg:text-start text-5xl lg:text-7xl tracking-wide font-semibold",children:["See my Thoughts and ",(0,n.jsx)("span",{className:"text-primary",children:"Blogs"})]}),(0,n.jsx)(t.default,{}),(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"mt-24 space-y-24",children:[(0,n.jsx)(a.default,{}),(0,n.jsx)(i.default,{})]})]})]})])}]);
