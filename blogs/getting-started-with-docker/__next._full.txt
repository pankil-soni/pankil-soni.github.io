7:Tad1,Today marks the beginning of my DevOps learning journey, and I kicked it off by diving into Docker. Here's what I learned and accomplished on my first day.

![](https://gs8r2a1o6v.ufs.sh/f/mIz0GfQ1TSOp15ugfLMrJFa2xozlgPE3sXhyABkpT4nVI7Uu)

**no more it works on my machine** 🚀

### Understanding the Basics

First, I grasped the fundamental concepts:

- **Containers**: Lightweight, standalone packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, ensuring consistency across different environments.

- **Docker**: A platform that enables creating, deploying, and running applications using container technology.

- **Docker Hub**: The official repository for Docker images, like GitHub but for container images.

## Essential Docker Commands

I learned several basic Docker commands that are crucial for container management:

### List all running containers

```bash
docker ps
```

### List all Docker images on your system

```bash
docker image ls
```

### Pull an image from Docker Hub

```bash
docker pull [image-name]
```

### Remove containers or images

```bash
docker rm [container-id/name]
```

### Run a container

```bash
docker run [options] [image-name]
```

## Hands-on Practice: Running Nginx

My first practical exercise was setting up an Nginx web server using Docker. Here's how I did it:

```bash
docker pull nginx
docker run --name my-nginx -p 8080:80 -d nginx
```

Let's break down this command:

- _**--name my-nginx**_: Assigns a custom name to the container

- _**-p 8080:80**_: Maps port 8080 on my host to port 80 in the container

- _**-d**_: Runs the container in detached mode (background)

- _**nginx**_: The image to use

## Connecting to Docker Playground

One interesting challenge I tackled was accessing Docker Playground from Windows using Git Bash via SSH. This gave me experience with:

- Remote container management

- Using SSH for remote connections

<https://stackoverflow.com/a/79113715/24263125> refer to my this comment to ssh docker playground instance.

## Key Takeaways from Day 1

1. Docker simplifies application deployment through containerization

2. Basic Docker commands are intuitive and follow a logical pattern

3. Port mapping is crucial for accessing containerized applications

4. Docker Playground provides a great environment for learning

## What's Next?

Tomorrow, I plan to explore:

- Create own docker image using as Dockerfile.

- Deploying own simple express app.

- Multi-container applications.

- Docker networking basics.

#Docker #DevOps #Learning #TechBlog8:T16b1,You've probably seen buzz about **MCP servers**, with some calling them the “USB-C of AI” or _game changers_ for autonomous agents. But here's the sober truth: we've been doing much of this long before MCP arrived — it just wasn't standardized. Let's peel back the layers.

![Model Context Protocols](https://gs8r2a1o6v.ufs.sh/f/mIz0GfQ1TSOpqZeM4zaMyAvRjGmzIU7kP02W5fhXlonVHC8B)

## So, what  _really_  is an MCP server?

**MCP**  stands for  **Model Context Protocol**  — an open-source standard released by Anthropic in late 2024 to let AI models connect to tools, data sources, files, databases, web APIs, and more.

Picture it as a translator: instead of prompts or vector embeddings, you now get JSON-structured dialogues saying, “I want to run this function on GitHub” or “read these files.”

That's what an  **MCP server**  handles:

-   Tool discovery
-   Structured requests
-   Execution and response
-   Error handling  
    All wrapped in one easy protocol.

## Wait — didn't agents already do that?

Absolutely.  **Before MCP**, you could:

-   Build a Claude or ChatGPT plugin using function-calling
-   Write glue code (scripts that poll data and format responses)
-   Use tools like Puppeteer or LangChain to simulate agent behavior

So yes —  **the core idea isn't new**. MCP is just an agreed-upon layer of  **generalization**.

Every integration earlier was custom. With MCP, you write a server once and plug it into any compliant AI. That's the difference.

## So what can MCP do that we couldn't do before?

There's no magic — it's about  **scalability and simplicity**.

### Before MCP

-   You had to write  **custom code per integration**
-   AI relied on  **manual instructions**  from developers
-   Embedded files were often  **static or stale**
-   **Manual workflows**  were stitched together across tools
-   Security was  **ad-hoc**, handled case by case

### After MCP

-   A  **single MCP server**  can serve many different models
-   Tools can be discovered automatically via a  **JSON spec**
-   Models can  **fetch real-time live data**, not just preloaded content
-   You can chain tools together easily (e.g.,  **GitHub → Slack → Notion**)
-   **Consent, authentication, and audit**  are built into the protocol

It saves  **engineering time**,  **reduces error**, and helps  **standardize access**  across agents.

## What could we do before MCP? Real examples:

Here's what developers  _already_  did without MCP:

-   **Code Automation**: Claude + GitHub API → Create PRs and merge automatically
-   **Docs Processing**: Poll Google Drive + convert docs to Markdown + summarize
-   **Data Fetching**: Web scraping latest stock prices → JSON → Summarize via GPT
-   **Slack Workflows**: Webhook triggers + message posting via Node.js

We were doing all this! It just wasn't reusable or standardized.

## Friendly Metaphor: USB-C for AI Tools

MCP is like  **USB-C**.

> Just plug in a server, let the AI discover what tools are available, and start using them.

There's no need for hardcoded APIs or bespoke wrappers anymore.
Even Microsoft is now adding native MCP support into its  **Windows AI Foundry**, letting you ask AI to “fetch this Excel file” or “show all images from yesterday” securely and naturally.

## Caveats & Reality Check

**Security**  matters.

-   Malicious servers could inject code or access sensitive data
-   Token misuse or prompt injection can still happen
-   Anthropic and other providers are working on mitigations like:
-   **MCP Guardian**  (sandboxing and throttling)
-   **MCPSafetyScanner**  (audits and scanning)
-   **RBAC policies and consent prompts**

You still need to  **design for safety**  — but now you don't need to reinvent that wheel either.

## What's Changed After MCP?

### Setup

-   **Before MCP**: Manual wiring of each tool and model
-   **After MCP**: Unified setup using a shared protocol

### Tool Usage

-   **Before MCP**: Custom integrations for each individual model
-   **After MCP**:  **Model-agnostic**  design, tools can be reused across models

### Security

-   **Before MCP**: DIY security with custom scripts
-   **After MCP**:  **Built-in**  features like consent flows,  **role-based access control (RBAC)**, and detailed audit logs

### Tool Chaining

-   **Before MCP**: Complex and brittle orchestration
-   **After MCP**: Natively supported tool chaining, easier automation

### Discovery

-   **Before MCP**: Static list of tools, often hardcoded
-   **After MCP**:  **Dynamic discovery**, guided by the AI itself

## Bottom Line

MCP didn't invent AI agents or tool use — it  **standardizes**  what many devs already built manually.

It's like finally agreeing on  **how all tools should connect**, instead of writing ad-hoc glue code for each one.

It doesn't make your AI smarter — but it makes your integrations  **workable at scale**, discoverable, secure, and future-proof.

So beyond the hype:  **MCP servers just wrapped years of custom engineering into a clean, open protocol**. And honestly? That's a big deal.

> “The biggest innovations often feel boring to engineers — because they make the hard parts disappear.”_  
> — Probably someone who's tired of maintaining glue code_9:T1317,As a Second-year B.Tech student majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, I was thrilled to land my first summer internship at Persist Ventures, a cutting-edge company developing AI-powered productivity tools, solutions and projects in many different domains. Little did I know that these three months would be a whirlwind of learning, challenges, and growth that would shape my understanding of AI applications in the real world.

# The Journey Begins

On April 9, 2024 I started working at Workplete (https://workplete.com/) Project of Persist Ventures and a mix of excitement and nervousness coursing through me. The team's warm welcome immediately put me at ease, and I was quickly introduced to the one of the two main projects I'd be working on: an Automatic Form Filler.

## Project 1: Automatic Form Filler (AFF)

![automatic form filler](https://gs8r2a1o6v.ufs.sh/f/mIz0GfQ1TSOp3BbFXH7p9cHFJMoKLVOdtle70W6DbmjG4BfQ)

My first task was to develop a Chrome extension that could automatically fill out online forms across multiple websites. Sounds simple, right? Well, not quite.

The challenge was to make it intelligent enough to understand different form structures so that it can work around any sort of website with forms and accurately map user-provided information to the correct fields.
The learning curve was steep. I had to quickly get up to speed with Chrome extension development, dive deep into the world of GPT-4 for intelligent field mapping, and learn how to optimize API calls to keep costs down. One of the biggest hurdles was handling the context length for GPT-4. The solution? Implementing FAISS Vector DB to reduce token length. It was my first time working with vector databases, and it opened up a whole new world of possibilities.

Seeing the extension's accuracy improve from 40% to 76% for the given sheet of different form links over the development period was incredibly rewarding. Even more gratifying was the positive feedback from beta testers, who reported saving a lot of time filling repetitive forms. It was my first taste of creating something that directly impacted users' lives.

## Project 2: Multi-Action Agent (MAA)

![Multi-Action Agent (MAA)](https://gs8r2a1o6v.ufs.sh/f/mIz0GfQ1TSOpZeKacxbsS74AXGUqul8gRNcVemdrQx19zbfJ)

Just as I was getting comfortable with the AFF, I was thrown into the deep end with the Multi-Action Agent project.

This was next-level stuff — an AI-powered browser assistant that could perform complex, multi-step tasks based on natural language commands.
The MAA pushed my skills to the limit. I had to grapple with natural language understanding, autonomous web navigation, and visual understanding of web pages using GPT-4's vision capabilities. The Chrome Debugger API became my new best friend (and occasional nemesis) as I worked on giving the agent more control over the browser.

One of the most exciting moments was when we successfully tested the MAA on tasks like **booking a cab on Uber or sending a WhatsApp message —all initiated with a simple text command.** It felt like we were building the future of web interaction.

# Beyond Technical Skills

While the technical skills I gained were invaluable, the soft skills I developed were equally important. I learned how to communicate complex technical concepts with the team. Team meetings and code reviews improved my ability to give and receive constructive feedback.
One of the most memorable experiences was presenting our projects to potential investors. It was nerve-wracking but exhilarating, and it gave me a glimpse into the business side of tech.

# Reflecting on the Journey

As I wrapped up my internship on July 1, 2024, I couldn't believe how much I had learned in just three months. From Chrome extension development to AI integration, from database management to UX design considerations, the experience was comprehensive and eye-opening.

But beyond the technical skills, this internship taught me about the real-world application of AI. It showed me how theoretical concepts I'd learned in university translated into products that could genuinely improve people's lives. It ignited a passion for creating AI-powered tools that are not just technically impressive, but also user-friendly and practical.

To all students considering internships: take the leap. The learning, the challenges, the victories — they're all part of an incredible journey that will shape your future in tech.

As I head back to complete my degree, I carry with me not just new skills and knowledge, but a renewed excitement for the future of AI and my role in shaping it. The journey has just begun, and I can't wait to see where it leads next.

This internship was more than just a summer job. It was a glimpse into the future — both the industry's and my own. And if this is just the beginning, I can't wait to see what comes next.0:{"P":null,"b":"JMVAg2MGnK0ciHldmY93s","c":["","blogs","getting-started-with-docker",""],"q":"","i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["blogs",{"children":["getting-started-with-docker",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],[["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/chunks/de0090d4a170a714.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","link","1",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/chunks/e28f606f91775eb0.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/9d4357b7300ff3a0.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-1",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/8c06a431c10035d8.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-2",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/1fbe02a193612ba9.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","className":"dark","children":["$","body",null,{"className":"relative outfit_9cdf565e-module__53g35q__className font-sans antialiased dark:bg-[#111214]","children":[["$","$L2",null,{}],["$","$L3",null,{}],["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-center mt-34 mb-32 lg:mb-18","children":"Made by Pankil Soni with ❤️"}]]}]}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","$L6",null,{"blog":{"title":"Getting Started with Docker 🐳","publishDate":"Oct 22, 2024","imageUrl":"/blogs/getting-started-with-docker.png","link":"/blogs/getting-started-with-docker","externalLink":"https://day-1-of-my-devops-journey-docker.hashnode.dev/day-1-of-my-devops-journey-getting-started-with-docker","markdownContent":"$7"},"moreBlogs":[{"title":"MCP Servers: Beyond the Hype 🚀","publishDate":"Jun 29, 2025","imageUrl":"/blogs/mcp-servers-beyond-the-hype.png","link":"/blogs/mcp-servers-beyond-the-hype","externalLink":"https://medium.com/@pmsoni2016/what-are-mcp-servers-beyond-the-hype-9863ba4c240d","markdownContent":"$8"},{"title":"My First tech Internship (Remote)","publishDate":"Jul 7, 2024","imageUrl":"/blogs/my-first-internship.png","link":"/blogs/my-first-internship","externalLink":"https://medium.com/@pmsoni2016/my-first-tech-internship-remote-building-ai-powered-automations-8e3790201bfe","markdownContent":"$9"}]}],["$La","$Lb","$Lc","$Ld"],"$Le"]}],{},null,false,false]},null,false,false]},null,false,false]},null,false,false],"$Lf",false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$10",[]],"S":true}
